# Unit 4 Challenge: Console Finances

## Description

Given a financial dataset describing a company's monthly Profit/Loss, compute a financial analysis and display it in a web browser's console.

The financial analysis includes:
- The total number of months covered
- The net total Profit/Loss over the entire period
- The average of the monthly changes in Profit/Loss
- The month that had the greatest increase in profits from the month before, and the amount of this increase
- The month with the greatest decrease in profits from the month before, and the amount of this decrease

In working on this project, I applied some of the knowledge gained on JavaScript basics, including how to retrieve data from nested arrays using `for` loops, template literals and rounding numbers.
